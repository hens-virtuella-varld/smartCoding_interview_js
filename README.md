# SmartCoding - PHASE 2 of the admission process for the Junior Full-Stack Developer course

This is my submission to PHASE 2 of the admission process for SmartCoding's Junior Full-Stack Developer course.
All the tasks in the assignment were done and below is the assignment description.
To check how the webspage works, clone or download the repository, and open the file `index.html` using your web browser.

## Assignment Description

A zipped folder with HTML, CSS, and Javascript is provided to download below ( “inline” javascript and CSS shall be used).
There are some “mistakes” that have been introduced in `index.html`. The mistakes are supposed to be fixed and to be presented during the next phase - an oral interview (live coding session) which will involve screen sharing tools such as Zoom or other.

### 5 tasks

1. Calculate the correct age of the individual that visits the website (For simplicity, only consider “full years”, ignore months and days).

2. If the person is over 25, put a RED circle/border around the avatar or picture of the person.

3. If the person is under 18, make sure that a GREEN circle/border shows up around the avatar

4. The name of what you type into the input has to be “titleized” - For example **mary** becomes **Mary**.

5. Do not use any 3rd party tool like jQuery (only pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript may be used in this challenge)
